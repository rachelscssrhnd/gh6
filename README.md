Submitted as part of Garuda Hacks 6.0.

Note:
Due to the large size of our project files, particularly the locally fine-tuned LLM models, we were unable to commit the full application to the GitHub repository. These models exceeded GitHubâ€™s size limitations and would not be practical to version control via Git.

As a result, the GitHub repo contains the core frontend and backend code structure, while the complete submission, including the AI models and full application environment, is provided via Google Drive. The Drive link ensures you can access, test, and review the project in its entirety.

We appreciate your understanding and are happy to provide further technical documentation or walkthroughs upon request.
